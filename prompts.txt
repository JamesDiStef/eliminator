1. create a top level folder called prompts.txt that contains a numbered list starting with this prompt. every prompt that is given for the lifetime of this project should be added to that file

2. connect and push to this repo @https://github.com/JamesDiStef/eliminator .  from now on every time a prompt is given to cursor the prompts.txt file should be updated, and all changes should be pushed to the remote repository.  the commit message shoudl be the prompt, proceeded by the word PROMPT in all caps and a colon

3. Create the main UI.  this should be a table with three columns.  the farthest level is the players name, and the next two columns should be drop down selectors where the user can pick any nfl team (in the second column) and every premier league team (in the third column).  keep in mind that future refactors will probably happen where different leagues could be used, so the implementation should not be tightly coupled with the team names

4. a blank page is rendering in the browser.  troubleshoot the UI and fix any issues so that the table appears on the screen

5. read this doc and fix the deployment issue i am having with github pages @https://vite.dev/guide/static-deploy.html

6. there are now too very similiar yml files under workflows, yet the page is still blank.  fix the deployment issue

7. Create an admin page.  Only the admin page should provide the utility to add a new player.  The mian page should just display the names in read only format

8. The dropdowns to select teams need to be on the main page.  the admin team should have add and delete the player name only

9. the page needs to support up to 18 weeks.  create a tabbing mechanism so that users can toggle between weeks and make their selections for each week.  also, when a user picks a team for one week, they cannot select it for another week - so if i pick the eagles for week one, i should not see the option to select it for any other week

10. Instead of tabs on the top, lets make it a stepper on the bottom where users can tab left and right or click on a week - like a paginator.  For the tabs on the top, add a tab that opens a read only table view of all selections all users have made for every week
